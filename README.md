 ### Deployment

**Vercel**

This project will be deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a cloud platform for front-end frameworks and static sites.

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

- **CI/CD Built-In:**  
  Vercel acts as a managed CI/CD platform. When changes are pushed to GitHub (e.g., to the `main` branch), Vercel:
  - Clones the repo
  - Installs dependencies
  - Builds the project
  - Deploys it automatically

- **Preview Deployments:**  
  Each pull request generates a unique preview URL so you can test changes before merging.

- **Production Deployment:**  
  Merging to `main` triggers an automatic deployment to the production domain, app rebuilds with new updates and re-deploys.

- **Global CDN:**  
  Vercel distributes your app on an edge network to serve it fast anywhere in the world.
