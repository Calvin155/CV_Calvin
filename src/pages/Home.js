          Welcome to my personal website! 
          <br />
          I am a Graduate Software Test Engineer, having achieved a 1:1 (1st Class Honours) degree at the Technological University of the Shannon Midlands (TUS) in 2025 
          (Graduation Ceremony in October 2025). Iâ€™m eager to advance my career in software testing and development, driven by a passion for building and ensuring high-quality, impactful software solutions.
          <br />
          Through college, CO-OP placements, and various experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in software development and DevOps practices, 
          along with a growing expertise in software quality assurance and automated testing. I am familiar with key concepts and practices such as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), 
          MVC architecture, REST API design and testing, DevOps methodologies and tools like Docker & Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms (AWS and Azure), 
          database design, and modern test automation frameworks.
          <br />
          I'm actively exploring opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and take on new challenges as part of a collaborative and innovative team.
          <br />
          Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch.
