                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to build a comprehensive <strong>Farm Management System</strong> for tracking and managing cattle on a farm. This included features for vaccination records, breed management, culling logs, milk production tracking, and animal sales. The system aimed to offer farmers a digital, centralized way to maintain complete records with full traceability.

                <p>
                    This group project showcases my ability to build real-world, data-driven desktop applications using <strong>C# and WinForms</strong>. It highlights experience working within an Agile team, applying object-oriented design patterns, using cloud-hosted databases, and consistently integrating client feedback. It also reflects strong communication, planning, and collaborative problem-solving skills within a team of 4.
